###### Block I 

```
This is explanation for block one. Showcase project highlights.
The computer halted on Sunday, June 13, shortly after 4 p.m. EDT.  
After analyzing the data, the Hubble operations team is investigating whether. 
a degrading memory module led to the computer halt. The team is preparing to  
switch to one of several backup modules on Wednesday, June 16.  
The computer will then be allowed to run for approximately one day to verify  
that the problem has been solved. The team would then restart all science  
instruments and return the telescope to normal science operations.
```

###### Block 2 

```
This is explanation for block two. Talk about the summary section.  
The payload computer is a NASA Standard Spacecraft Computer-1 (NSSC-1)  
system built in the 1980s. It is part of the Science Instrument  
Command and Data Handling module, which was replaced during the  
last astronaut servicing mission in 2009. The module has various  
levels of redundancy which can be switched on to serve as the primary  
system when necessary.

###### Block 3 

```
This is explanation for block three. 
The Hubble Space Telescope is deployed on April 25,  
1990 from the space shuttle Discovery. Avoiding distortions of  
the atmosphere, Hubble has an unobstructed view peering  
to planets, stars and galaxies, some more than 13.4 billion  
light years away.

###### Block 3 

```
Final notes. 
Sure, a real-life Epstein drive is still a few  
breakthroughs away. But the rocket-building game  
lets you pilot a fusion-propelled craft right now.
